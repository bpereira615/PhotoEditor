Photo Editor:
This program allows users to manipulate .ppm files by:
-cropping
-inverting color
-swapping channels
-making grayscale
-blurring
-sharpening
-adjusting contrast
-mirroring image
-toggling 90 degree left rotation of image



Source Files:
hw6.c - driver file with function call that runs the program
ppmIO.c - contains functions used to handle input and output of ppm files
menuUtil.c - contains functions that handle interaction with user and 
  executing commmands on the given image
imageManip.c - contains functions that manipulate the image in a desired way

ppmIO.h - header file containing function declarations of ppmIO.c
menuUtil.h - header file containing function declarations of menuUtil.c
imageManip.h - header file containing function declarations of imageManip.c

Makefile - used to compile, no unit tests written for the Makefile-testing was
done manually
mercurial.log- mercurial log file of commits



Overall, this assignment was fair. The directions were very clear and easy
to follow. Handling the image and storing its data in an array of pixel structs 
was by far the most difficult aspect. Once we had the pixel array, writing the
manipulating fuctions was straightforward.
